## Credits

Widgets are from [aweseome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets), by [streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle), slightly modified by me.

I made it based on [MeledoJames](https://github.com/MeledoJames/awesome-setup), [WillPower3309](https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles), [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats) and [raven2cz](https://github.com/raven2cz/awesomewm-config) config files.
