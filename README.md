WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY YET

# My Awesome WM custom configurations

These are my configs for Awesome, in a repository so I can more easily share them on different computers.

## Dependencies

- [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/)

## Installation

Clone this repository in your `.config`:

```
git clone https://github.com/eldskald/awesome-config.git ~/.config/awesome
```

Then, create your `custom.lua` file with your default settings. Use `custom.lua.example` as a template.

## Credits

I made it based on [WillPower3309](https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles), [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats) and [raven2cz](https://github.com/raven2cz/awesomewm-config) config files.

All widgets are from [WillPower3309](https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles).
